Bugs:
1) When user types but enters no name, it is handled except keys still remain in textbox - FIXED
2) When user types name, then types message, 
then changes name without changing message, it will say the original name is typing - FIXED
3) when two people type at the same time, it only shows the most recent person typing and once that person sends
the other guy still typing is no longer shown to anyone
